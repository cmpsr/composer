# ANALYTICS

## Philosophy

To be analytic provider agnostic while mirroring itself into the React ecosystem. Since Segment is also trying to do the same thing, their API makes sense as a good base.

## How it works

React app is wrapped in `<AnalyticsProvider>` which passes `context` down with functions to track user activities. When these functions are called, it will loop through all valid analytics providers and call their equivalent api.

## API

**identify**: Let the provider know who the logged in user is
**group**: If there are multiple portals, this helps separate them. This is advanced.
**page**: Track a new page, can be added to Next's router
**track**: Track an even such as a button click
**user**: Returns the auto assigned id
**reset**: Clear the _identity_
